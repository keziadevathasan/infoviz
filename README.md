The final project for CSC511 entails visualizing students' emotional journeys over a 4-month, work integrated learning program.

The dimensions of the data set are a set of emotions felt by students in a term-long capstone program or team project-based course, causes for each emotion, and a set of strategies to manage the emotions. Explicitly, the columns in this dataset are as follows: Week-Number, Sadness, Fear, Anger, Surprise, Disappointment, Happiness, Causes, Student-Strategies, and Instructor-Strategies. Each data case pertains to a weekly written reflection submitted by each student (across 16 weeks, across 24 students).
